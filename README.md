# Facial_Image_Generation

**Workflow Point 1**:
- **Development**: Engineered and trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model using 30,000 facial images with GPU acceleration to generate realistic new faces. Designed and implemented the GAN architecture, comprising a generator and discriminator, to enhance face generation quality.

**Workflow Point 2**:
- **Deployment**: Developed an interactive user interface using Streamlit for real-time face generation, enabling seamless user experience and allowing users to generate faces interactively.

**Tech Stack**: Deep Learning, Neural Networks, GAN Model, Facial Image Generation, Streamlit
